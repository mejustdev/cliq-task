# TODO LIST


**Language:** Pick one between ReactJS / NextJS

### **Expected result:** Something that works, and show how you code on a daily basis :) You can send the result as you prefer as long as we can retrieve it (archive, github link, bitbucket, ....).
### The goal is to code a simple Todo List in two steps. The expected behavior is as follows:

1. An input field where you can enter a task, and an &quot;Add&quot; button. Once the task is added, it
will appear in a list below.

2. The most recent tasks will be displayed at the top of the list.

3. Each task can be validated or deleted by a simple action. A validated task will appear in
grey, and a deleted task will be removed from the list.
